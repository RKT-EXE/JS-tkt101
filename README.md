**Item Lister Application**

**Overview** : 
This is a simple web application that allows users to add and remove items from a list.

**Files** :
index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
script.js: The JavaScript file with the logic for adding and removing items from the list.
Bootstrap CSS and Icons: External dependencies for styling and icons.

**Usage**:
* Open index.html in a web browser.
* Enter an item in the "Add Items" input field.
* Click the "Submit" button to add the item to the list.
* Each item in the list has a delete button ("X"). Clicking it prompts a confirmation dialog.
* Confirm to delete the item, or cancel to keep it.

**Structure**:
The web page consists of a navigation bar, an input form to add items, and a list of items.
The JavaScript file (script.js) handles form submission to add items and click events to remove items.

**Dependencies**:
Bootstrap 5: External CSS framework for styling.
Bootstrap Icons: External library for icons.

**Customization**:
Feel free to customize the HTML and CSS to fit your design preferences.
Update the JavaScript logic in script.js for additional features or modifications.

**Notes**:
The application uses vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap for styling.
Ensure all external dependencies are correctly linked for the proper functioning of the application.
